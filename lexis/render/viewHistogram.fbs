// This event is used to communicate histograms for
// 8 bit data between applications ( also inside the
// application ). Some fields are application specific.
// "area" and "id". These fields
// are used to accumulate diffent histograms from
// different render clients for the same view.
// Every rendered frame has a unique identifier "id".
//
// Currently every data is discretized to 256 bins.
// This may change later to higer number of bins if
// needed.
//
// Note: When ZeroBuf has a method to include other
// fbs files, the application specific areas can be
// application event and histogram may stay without
// the viewportArea" and "id" fields.
